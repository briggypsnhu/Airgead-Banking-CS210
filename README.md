# Airgead-Banking-CS210

### Summary

*   Summarize the project and what problem it was solving:

    *   This program lets the users of Airgead Banking know how their
    investments will grow over time.
    *   In this program, users can input anm initial deposit amount, a
    monthly deposit amount, the desired interest rate and the number
    of years for the investment to grow.


*   What did you do particularly well?
    *   Something I think I did particulary well was write clean and concise code by following Airgead Banking's coding guidelines


*   Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
    *   To improve my code I could have added more clear comments throughout, along with being more consistent with my naming conventions which improves the effiency and readabnility of my code for whoever would be working on it next. 


*   Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support --network?
    *   I found keeping the driver file "clean" and limiting it to only a few lines the hardest, but it helped better my familiarity working with multiple files at once.


*   What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
    *   Using a guideline is helpful for real world project experiance, because many companies do require their developers to use a standardized format with the code to ensure that it is held to a certain standard.
